# ValiBjorn Founder Operating Brief
## CaseBase — Litigation Intelligence for High-Conflict Divorce
Generated: February 7, 2026

---

## VERDICT: GO ✅
**Confidence: 73%**

CaseBase solves a genuine, expensive, hair-on-fire problem with a working prototype that already demonstrates capabilities no competitor offers. The founder has authentic domain expertise, a functioning product tested on real case data, and a clear path to cash-flow-positive revenue from case #1. The primary risks — UPL exposure, solo founder bottleneck, and market ceiling — are all manageable with disciplined execution. This is not a moonshot; it's a high-margin, bootstrappable professional services business with a viable path to a SaaS platform. Lead with B2B law firms, treat B2C as a referral funnel, and build the plane while flying it.

## 1. IDEA SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Key Finding |
|-----------|:---:|-------------|
| Problem Severity | **9** | Attorneys drown in 5,000-50,000+ documents per case. Manual review costs $6-12K and misses cross-document patterns. |
| Market Size | **6** | SAM $120-600M. Sufficient for a highly profitable business but likely not VC-scale without vertical expansion. |
| Founder-Market Fit | **10** | Built the tool for own case. Lived the problem. Deep domain expertise that can't be faked. |
| Competitive Advantage | **9** | No competitor does AI behavioral pattern detection for family law. 9-category coparenting taxonomy is genuinely novel. |
| Business Model Viability | **8** | 95% gross margin (ex-founder labor). Cash-positive from case #1. Per-case pricing with retainer expansion. |
| Unit Economics | **8** | $7,500/case at ~60-70% gross margin (inc. imputed labor). LTV:CAC of 6:1 for B2B. 4-month payback. |
| Distribution Feasibility | **6** | Family law is relationship-driven with 2-8 week sales cycles. Referral loops are powerful but slow to start. |
| Product Buildability | **9** | Prototype already works. Gap is client-facing UI and multi-tenant architecture — significant but well-defined engineering. |
| Fundraise Readiness | **4** | Not needed and not recommended yet. Bootstrap first. Raise only at 20+ clients for platform acceleration. |
| Legal/Regulatory Risk | **5** | UPL is the existential risk. Manageable with proper framing as "litigation support" but requires legal counsel ASAP. |
| Team Readiness | **5** | Solo technical founder. Can handle 8-10 cases. First hire (document analyst) needed by case 10. |
| Timing | **8** | AI in legal is hot. Attorneys are warming to AI tools. No incumbent in the niche. Window is open now. |

**Overall Score: 87/120 — Strong GO**

---

## 2. THE BUSINESS IN ONE PAGE

**Problem**: High-conflict divorce cases generate thousands of communications and documents. Critical behavioral patterns — reversals, manufactured crises, escalation cycles, coparenting obstruction — are invisible without systematic analysis. Attorneys spend 40-80 hours per case on manual review and still miss cross-document patterns.

**Solution**: CaseBase ingests all case documents (OFW messages, emails, motions, incident reports) into a secure database and uses AI analysis to automatically detect behavioral patterns, contradictions, timeline anomalies, and communication shifts — surfacing court-ready pattern evidence in hours instead of weeks.

**Customer**: Family law attorneys at boutique firms (3-15 attorneys) handling 3+ active high-conflict cases. Secondary: individuals navigating high-conflict divorces (B2C as referral funnel to B2B).

**Insight**: The founder built this for their own high-conflict divorce case. Every feature exists because it solved a real problem. General eDiscovery tools are built for commercial litigation, not family law behavioral analysis. This is a genuine white space.

**Model**: Per-case retainer ($5,000-10,000/case) for law firms, expanding to monthly subscription at 3+ cases. B2C subscription at $49-149/mo.

**Positioning**: *For family law attorneys handling high-conflict divorce cases who drown in thousands of messages and miss critical behavioral patterns, CaseBase is a litigation intelligence platform that automatically detects coparenting obstruction, manufactured crises, and communication pattern shifts across all case documents. Unlike manual review or general eDiscovery tools, CaseBase surfaces court-ready pattern evidence in minutes instead of weeks.*

## 3. CRITICAL RISKS (Top 5)

### Risk 1: Unauthorized Practice of Law (UPL)
- **Severity**: HIGH — could shut down the business
- **Mitigation**: Position strictly as "litigation support service." All outputs surface patterns with citations — never interpret or recommend legal strategy. Require disclaimers. Engage a legal tech attorney before first paying client. B2C segment requires individuals to have legal counsel or explicitly limits deliverables to data summaries only.
- **Owner**: Founder + legal counsel (immediate)

### Risk 2: Solo Founder Bottleneck
- **Severity**: MEDIUM — caps revenue at ~$300K/year at current capacity
- **Mitigation**: At 13-26 hours per case, capacity is 8-10 active cases before quality degrades. Hire document analyst (paralegal with tech aptitude, $50-70K) at case #8. Automate ingestion pipeline to cut per-case hours by 40%.
- **Owner**: Founder (hire at month 4-6)

### Risk 3: API Cost / Vendor Lock-in
- **Severity**: MEDIUM — Anthropic pricing changes could crush margins
- **Mitigation**: Implement tiered model usage (Haiku for screening, Opus for deep analysis). Build caching layer. Track API cost per case weekly with a 70% gross margin hard floor. Evaluate alternative providers (but Opus quality is currently unmatched for this use case).
- **Owner**: Founder (monitor weekly)

### Risk 4: Data Breach of Sensitive Legal Data
- **Severity**: HIGH — catastrophic to business and clients
- **Mitigation**: Encryption at rest + in transit (Supabase provides). RBAC with audit logging. Data processing agreements with all clients. Incident response plan. Cyber liability + E&O insurance before first client. SOC 2 on 12-month roadmap.
- **Owner**: Founder (before first client)

### Risk 5: Market Size Ceiling
- **Severity**: MEDIUM — not existential but limits upside
- **Mitigation**: High-conflict divorce is ~75K-112K cases/year in the US. At $10K/case, theoretical TAM is $750M-$1.1B. Sufficient for $1-10M ARR. Expansion paths: other high-conflict family law (custody modification, protective orders), civil harassment, elder abuse litigation. Cross-bridge when market proves out.
- **Owner**: Founder (Year 2+ strategic decision)

---

## 4. CROSS-SKILL INSIGHTS

### Reinforcing Signals (7+ agents agree)
- **B2B-first is the correct strategy** — every agent independently recommends law firms over individuals as the primary segment. Higher ACV, longer retention, concentrated channels, legal cover under work product doctrine.
- **The working prototype is a massive differentiator** — Product, Sales, Idea Validation, and GTM agents all flag that having a functioning system with real analytical capabilities is a rare advantage at this stage.
- **Founder domain expertise IS the moat** — Marketing, Sales, Idea Validation, and Operations all identify the founder's lived experience as the most defensible competitive advantage.
- **Cash-flow positive from day one** — Finance, Business Model, and Fundraising agents all confirm this is a bootstrappable business that doesn't need capital to be viable.
- **Free pilot case is the best sales tool** — Sales, GTM, and Customer Success agents converge on "show, don't tell" — analyzing one real case thread converts attorneys faster than any pitch deck.
- **UPL risk is the #1 legal threat** — Legal, Sales, Marketing, and Growth agents all flag this. The business is viable IF framing stays on the right side of the line.

### Contradictions Found
- **Business Model says $500-2,000/mo subscription vs. Sales says $5,000-15,000/case**: Resolution — start with per-case pricing to reduce commitment barrier and prove value. Transition high-volume firms to monthly subscription (effectively retainer) at 3+ cases. Both are correct for different stages.
- **Fundraising says "possibly never raise" vs. Product says "needs engineering hire for platform build"**: Resolution — bootstrap through the productized service phase (Year 1). Self-fund or use revenue-based financing for platform build if needed. VC only at 20+ clients and $300K+ ARR, if ever.
- **Growth says "B2C as lead-gen funnel" vs. Legal says "B2C has highest UPL risk"**: Resolution — B2C can exist but must be heavily disclaimed, limited to data summaries (no interpretive framing), and ideally require users to have legal counsel. Position B2C as a self-serve version that helps individuals organize evidence for their attorney, not replace one.

### Information Gaps
- **Actual Claude API cost per case**: Need to meter real API spend across 5-10 cases to validate the 75% gross margin assumption. This is the biggest unknown in unit economics.
- **Attorney willingness to pay**: No customer interviews with non-founder attorneys yet. Need 10-15 Mom Test conversations with family law attorneys to validate pricing and pain point severity.
- **State-by-state UPL variance**: UPL rules differ by state. Need legal counsel to assess risk in founder's home jurisdiction and top 5 target markets.
- **SOC 2 timeline and cost**: Estimates range from $30-100K+ and 6-12 months. Need concrete quotes from compliance consultants.
- **Competitive response risk**: If Relativity or a well-funded legal tech startup moves into family law AI, how defensible is CaseBase's position? Need ongoing competitive monitoring.

---

## 5. 90-DAY ACTION PLAN

### Month 1: Validate & Legalize
- **Week 1-2**: Engage a legal tech attorney. Draft engagement agreement, NDA, data processing agreement, data retention policy, UPL-safe deliverable templates. Get E&O and cyber liability insurance quotes.
- **Week 3-4**: Run 10-15 Mom Test conversations with family law attorneys (not the founder's own attorney). Validate: Is the pain real? What would they pay? What concerns would stop them? What deliverable format do they want?
- **Key milestone**: Legal structure in place. 10+ attorney conversations completed. Pricing hypothesis validated or adjusted.

### Month 2: Pilot & Prove
- **Week 5-6**: Offer free pilot case analysis to 3-5 attorneys from the validation interviews (best candidates). Deliver full pattern analysis on one real case per firm. Track time-to-first-insight and attorney reaction.
- **Week 7-8**: Iterate on deliverable format based on pilot feedback. Build a simple web-based report delivery mechanism (even a password-protected static site beats screen-sharing). Close first 1-2 paying clients from pilot conversions.
- **Key milestone**: 3-5 pilots delivered. 1-2 paying retainers signed. Pilot-to-retainer conversion rate established.

### Month 3: Revenue & System
- **Week 9-10**: Meter API costs across all pilot/paying cases. Build unit economics dashboard. Instrument all key metrics (time per case, patterns surfaced, API cost per case). Begin content marketing — publish first 2-3 thought leadership articles.
- **Week 11-12**: Close 2-3 additional paying clients from pilot referrals and network outreach. Submit first CLE speaking proposal to state bar family law section. Begin scoping client-facing dashboard (Phase 2 product).
- **Key milestone**: 3-5 paying clients. $15-40K total revenue. Unit economics validated. Content pipeline started.

## 7. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

- **Motion**: Sales-led (B2B) + Community-driven (B2C referral funnel)
- **Primary Channel**: Direct referral network + free pilot case analysis
- **Beachhead Market**: Boutique family law firms (3-15 attorneys) with steady pipeline of high-conflict cases

### First 100 Customers Strategy

**Phase 1 (Customers 1-5): Founder Network**
- Personal network of family law attorneys
- Free pilot on one real case → convert to retainer
- Target: 60%+ pilot-to-retainer conversion

**Phase 2 (Customers 5-20): Referral Engine**
- Satisfied attorneys refer peers (family law is tight-knit)
- CLE presentations at state bar family law sections
- Target: 30%+ referral rate from existing clients

**Phase 3 (Customers 20-50): Content + Conference**
- Thought leadership content in legal publications
- Speaking at ABA TECHSHOW, AAML conferences
- B2C-to-B2B bridge (individuals bring organized evidence to attorneys, attorneys become leads)

**Phase 4 (Customers 50-100): Platform + Scale**
- Client-facing dashboard enables self-serve onboarding
- Partner with practice management software (Clio, MyCase)
- Regional expansion with dedicated sales capacity

### Growth Loops

1. **Attorney Evidence Loop** (B2B Viral): Attorney uses CaseBase → surfaces novel evidence → opposing counsel notices quality → inquires about tool → new firm onboards
2. **Client-to-Attorney Bridge** (B2C→B2B): Individual signs up → uploads documents → brings analysis to attorney → attorney sees value → firm inquires
3. **Community Validation Loop** (B2C Organic): Individual uses CaseBase → finds validating patterns → shares in divorce support community → peers sign up
4. **CLE/Thought Leadership Loop** (B2B Content): Founder publishes methodology → presents at CLEs → attorneys learn about pattern detection → seek CaseBase
5. **Multi-Case Expansion Loop** (B2B Expansion): Firm uses on one case → sees ROI → applies to next case → becomes power user

### What NOT to Do
- Don't market as "AI" to attorneys — market as "litigation intelligence"
- Don't market B2C publicly — keep as referral channel to avoid UPL concerns
- Don't use aggressive direct marketing — legal profession responds to authority, not urgency
- Don't promise outcomes — promise insights and efficiency

**North Star Metric**: Actionable Patterns Surfaced Per Active Case

---

## 9. FUNDRAISE ASSESSMENT

- **Ready to raise?**: **No — and that's a strength, not a weakness.**
- **Recommended path**: Bootstrap. Business is cash-flow positive from case #1 with 95% gross margin (ex-labor). Fundraising is a distraction until product-market fit is proven with paying customers.
- **Bootstrappability Score**: 9/10

### When Fundraising Makes Sense
**Trigger**: 20+ paying law firm clients, proven retention, ready to build self-serve platform. At this point, $500K-$2M could accelerate:
- Engineering hire to build client-facing dashboard
- SOC 2 certification
- Multi-jurisdiction expansion
- Sales/marketing to scale beyond founder-led growth

### If You Do Raise: Investor Fit

| Investor Type | Fit | Rationale |
|--------------|-----|-----------|
| Legal tech angels | Best | Understand sales cycles, bring industry connections |
| Revenue-based financing | Good | No dilution, predictable payback from high margins |
| Small vertical funds | Good | Patient capital, domain expertise |
| Traditional VC (Seed/A) | Poor | Market size doesn't match 10x return expectations unless expanding beyond family law |

### Alternative: Lifestyle Business
$300K-$1M+/year with 2-5 employees, full founder ownership, deeply meaningful work. This is not a "failure to scale" — it's a successful, profitable, impactful business.

---

## 10. LEGAL CHECKLIST

- **Entity**: LLC (single-member initially). Convert to S-Corp when profit exceeds $60-80K for SE tax savings.

### Immediate Actions (Before First Paying Client)
- [ ] Engage legal tech attorney for UPL assessment in home jurisdiction
- [ ] Draft engagement agreement / retainer agreement
- [ ] Draft mutual NDA
- [ ] Draft data processing agreement (DPA)
- [ ] Draft data retention and destruction policy
- [ ] Add UPL disclaimers to all deliverables ("This is data analysis, not legal advice")
- [ ] Obtain E&O insurance
- [ ] Obtain cyber liability insurance
- [ ] Implement audit logging on all case data access
- [ ] Create incident response plan for data breaches
- [ ] Verify no court orders restrict data sharing before each case ingestion

### Before Fundraise (If Applicable)
- [ ] Convert to C-Corp (if pursuing VC) or maintain S-Corp (if bootstrapping)
- [ ] Clean cap table, vesting schedule, IP assignment
- [ ] SOC 2 Type I certification (or clear timeline to Type II)
- [ ] Patent/IP assessment for novel analysis methodology

### Regulatory Considerations
- [ ] State-by-state UPL rules for top 5 target markets
- [ ] AI disclosure requirements in legal proceedings (emerging area — monitor)
- [ ] HIPAA applicability if medical records are part of case files
- [ ] Court order verification process before ingesting restricted data
- [ ] Anthropic/Claude API terms of service for legal use cases
- [ ] Review emerging state AI legislation (Colorado AI Act, etc.)

### UPL Safe Harbor: The Line

**SAFE** (pattern detection / data analysis):
- "Here are 47 instances where Party A agreed to a schedule, then reversed within 48 hours"
- "Hostility scores increase 3x in the week before court dates"
- "Here are the 12 strongest examples of gatekeeping behavior, ranked by severity score"

**NOT SAFE** (legal interpretation / strategy):
- "This pattern of reversals would support a motion for modification of custody"
- "Based on this analysis, you should file for a change of venue"
- "This evidence demonstrates that Party A is an unfit parent"

*Note: This is educational information, not legal advice. Consult a qualified attorney.*

## 11. SALES PLAYBOOK

### Sales Motion: Challenger + Proof-of-Concept

**Step 1: Teach** — Lead with insight, not product. Share a surprising pattern statistic from anonymized data. The founder's deep domain knowledge IS the sales pitch.

**Step 2: Tailor** — Offer to analyze a single thread or communication set from an active case — 30-60 minutes of founder time to show what CaseBase finds.

**Step 3: Take Control** — Once the attorney sees a pattern they missed, close on the full case analysis.

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is this admissible in court?" | CaseBase surfaces patterns in existing evidence. Every finding cites specific documents. It's an analytical tool, like a forensic accountant's report. The attorney decides what to use. |
| "How do I know the AI is accurate?" | Every finding includes citations to source documents. The attorney can verify any pattern against the originals. CaseBase is a force multiplier for attorney judgment, not a replacement. |
| "What about confidentiality?" | Hardened Supabase security, data isolation per case, no data sharing between clients, NDAs and DPAs signed. SOC 2 on roadmap. |
| "I can't justify this to my client." | This replaces 40-80 hours of paralegal review at $150/hour. You're paying $5,000-10,000 for what would cost $6,000-12,000 in manual review — and getting analysis manual review cannot produce. |
| "AI in legal makes me nervous." | The founder personally reviews every analysis before delivery. This isn't a chatbot generating legal advice — it's a structured intelligence system operated with domain expertise. |

### Pricing Presentation
- **Anchor high**: Initial quote at $12,000-15,000 per case
- **Pilot offer**: $3,000-5,000 for a single-thread deep dive
- **Retainer conversion**: After pilot, monthly retainer at $5,000-8,000 for ongoing analysis

### Key Sales Metrics
- Pilot-to-retainer conversion rate: target 60%+
- Time from first contact to signed retainer: target <30 days
- Average revenue per firm per year
- Referral rate from satisfied clients

---

## 12. MARKETING & BRAND STRATEGY

### Brand Identity
- **Core positioning**: "CaseBase brings shape to chaos."
- **Brand archetype**: The Expert Ally — authoritative, trustworthy, deeply competent
- **Category**: Litigation Intelligence for Family Law (subcategory, not new category)
- **Key differentiator**: "We don't just search your case files. We detect the patterns that win custody cases."

### Content Marketing Pillars

| Pillar | Example Topics | Channel |
|--------|---------------|---------|
| Pattern Education | "The Anatomy of a Manufactured Crisis in Custody Litigation" | Blog, LinkedIn, Legal publications |
| Cost/Efficiency | "The Hidden Cost of Manual Document Review in Family Law" | Blog, CLE presentations |
| Case Studies | Anonymized before/after: hours saved, patterns surfaced | Website, sales collateral |
| Industry Thought Leadership | "How AI is Changing High-Conflict Family Law" | Speaking engagements, bar publications |

### Trust Signals (Priority Order)
1. Founder credentials and domain expertise
2. Security certifications and data handling policies
3. Attorney testimonials (anonymized case outcomes)
4. CLE presentations and published articles
5. Professional liability insurance documentation

### Marketing Budget Allocation (Year 1)
- Content creation: 40% (founder time + occasional ghostwriter)
- Conference attendance/speaking: 25%
- Website and digital presence: 15%
- Networking/referral cultivation: 15%
- Paid advertising: 5% (legal-specific channels only)

## 13. CUSTOMER SUCCESS FRAMEWORK

### Onboarding Flow (Law Firms)

| Day | Activity | Success Metric |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| 0 | Sign retainer + NDA + DPA | Contracts executed |
| 1-3 | Receive case documents, ingest, confirm scope | Documents ingested |
| 3-5 | First pattern analysis delivered | Time to first insight <48 hrs |
| 5-7 | Walk-through with lead attorney | "Aha moment" achieved |
| 7-14 | Iterate on deliverable format, add documents | Format finalized |
| Ongoing | Regular updates as new documents arrive | Patterns surfaced per update |
| Case end | Final report, data disposition, referral ask | Testimonial + referral |

### Customer Health Scoring

| Signal | Healthy | At Risk |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Document upload frequency | Regular (weekly+) | Stopped uploading |
| Report view frequency | Weekly | Haven't viewed in 30+ days |
| Support tickets | Questions about features | Complaints about accuracy |
| Expansion | Adding cases | Single case, no expansion |
| Engagement | Requests ad hoc analysis | Radio silence |

### Churn Prevention
- Build relationships with multiple attorneys at each firm (not just one)
- Offer discounted "standby" retainer between cases
- Follow up on whether insights were used and how
- Proactive alerts when new patterns emerge from ongoing monitoring
- Quarterly business reviews on active cases

### The Lifecycle Churn Challenge
Divorce cases end. This creates structural churn that cannot be reduced by product improvements. Mitigation:
- Target firms with multiple active high-conflict cases (not individuals with one case)
- Per-firm retention, not per-case retention, is the real metric
- Expansion revenue from additional cases offsets individual case churn
- Target NRR of 120%+ at the firm level

## 16. WHAT COULD KILL THIS

### 1. UPL Enforcement Action
If a state bar determines CaseBase's analysis constitutes unauthorized practice of law — particularly in the B2C segment — the business faces a cease-and-desist or worse. **This is existential.** A single enforcement action could shut down operations and destroy the brand. Mitigation is non-negotiable: get legal counsel, frame as litigation support, disclaim aggressively, and consider B2B-only until UPL risk is fully mapped.

### 2. Founder Burnout or Capacity Ceiling
At 13-26 hours per case, one person can handle ~8-10 active cases before quality degrades. If demand exceeds capacity before the first hire (or the hire is bad), the founder faces declining quality → unhappy clients → reputation damage → business failure. The founder IS the business right now. No redundancy. Hire early (at case #8, not #15), automate aggressively, maintain quality even if it means turning away clients.

### 3. Data Breach
A breach of sensitive family law data — children's information, abuse allegations, financial records, sealed documents — would be catastrophic. Not just legally (breach notifications, lawsuits) but reputationally. No law firm would ever trust CaseBase again. Security isn't a feature — it's a prerequisite. Encryption, access controls, audit logging, incident response plan, and insurance must all be in place before the first paying client.
