# ValiBjorn Founder Operating Brief
## The Soft Report
Generated: 2026-02-11

---

## VERDICT: CONDITIONAL GO
**Confidence: 73%**

The Soft Report occupies a genuine white space — no one is combining ASMR's 50M+ monthly search audience with daily AI/tech news. The financial profile is exceptionally low-risk: $2,200/month operating costs against effectively infinite runway from freelance income. The 7-stage automated pipeline is technically buildable by this founder (proven by CaseBase). However, zero customer validation exists. The concept has never been tested with a real audience. The conditional GO means: **build a minimal pipeline in 2 weeks, produce 10 test episodes, measure audience response, then decide whether to invest in full automation.** Do not build the full 7-stage pipeline blind.

## 1. IDEA SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Key Finding |
|-----------|:---:|-------------|
| Problem Severity | 5 | Real annoyance (dry tech news), but not a burning pain point |
| Market Size | 7 | ASMR (50M+ searches/mo) x AI news = large addressable intersection |
| Founder-Market Fit | 7 | Strong Python dev, built CaseBase in 2 weeks, gets AI pipeline architecture |
| Competitive Advantage | 8 | No direct competitor in ASMR + news. Counter-positioning moat |
| Business Model Viability | 7 | Multi-revenue (AdSense + Patreon + Sponsorships + Affiliate). J-curve economics |
| Unit Economics | 8 | $73/episode cost, $243/episode revenue at Month 12 scale (70% margin) |
| Distribution Feasibility | 6 | YouTube Shorts + Reddit as primary channels. Cold start problem is real |
| Product Buildability | 8 | Founder has proven technical capability. ElevenLabs/HeyGen quality is the binary risk |
| Fundraise Readiness | 2 | Not applicable — bootstrap is the correct and only recommended strategy |
| Legal/Regulatory Risk | 5 | Copyright/fair use for news aggregation is #1 legal risk. YouTube AI content policies evolving |
| Team Readiness | 4 | Solo founder with ADHD/cyclothymia. Producer/accountability partner is P0 hire |
| Timing | 7 | AI video gen just crossed quality threshold. 9-month competitive window before copycats |

**Overall Score: 74/120**

## 2. THE BUSINESS IN ONE PAGE

**Problem**: AI/tech news is overwhelming, dry, and dominated by talking heads or faceless voiceover channels. No one has combined the massive ASMR audience with daily tech news.

**Solution**: A daily 5-minute AI news briefing on YouTube, delivered by an AI-generated female host in ASMR whisper voice, set against rotating exotic global backdrops. Fully automated 7-stage pipeline enables daily publishing with <1hr/week founder time.

**Customer**: Primary: AI/tech enthusiasts who consume daily AI news. Secondary: ASMR community (~50M+ monthly searches) seeking novel content. Crossover: people who want to stay informed but find traditional tech news exhausting.

**Insight**: The intersection of ASMR and tech news is unoccupied. AI automation tools will flood YouTube with low-effort content — editorial voice and character IP become the scarce resource and the real moat.

**Model**: Multi-revenue content brand — AdSense ($5-10 CPM), Patreon (tiered $5-$50), Sponsorships ($1-5K/segment at scale), Affiliate ($5-20/conversion), Character IP/merch (long-term).

**Positioning**: For AI/tech enthusiasts who are tired of dry, overwhelming news coverage, The Soft Report is a daily whispered briefing that makes staying informed feel like unwinding. Unlike traditional tech news channels, we combine editorial intelligence with ASMR's calming sensory experience.

## 3. CRITICAL RISKS (Top 5)

### Risk 1: Zero Customer Validation
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Detail**: The concept is at "shower thought" stage. No episodes produced, no audience tested, no evidence that ASMR + tech news crossover actually works at scale. The 50M ASMR search volume and AI news interest may not overlap as assumed.
- **Mitigation**: Produce 10 test episodes before building the full pipeline. Measure: average view duration >50%, like ratio >85%, and any organic subscriber growth. If these fail across 10 episodes, PIVOT the format.
- **Owner**: Founder

### Risk 2: YouTube AI Content Policy Risk
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Detail**: YouTube's policies on AI-generated content are evolving rapidly. Potential for demonetization, deranking, or mandatory disclosure that changes audience perception. 68-85% of operating costs are API-dependent — if HeyGen or ElevenLabs discontinues service or changes ToS, the pipeline breaks.
- **Mitigation**: Build provider abstraction layer. Never hard-code to a single provider. Test alternatives monthly. The voice actress path is already a hedge against ElevenLabs. Maintain human voice as primary path. Diversify revenue away from AdSense dependency.
- **Owner**: Founder

### Risk 3: Founder Sustainability (ADHD/Cyclothymia)
- **Severity**: HIGH
- **Detail**: Pipeline is designed for autonomy, but community management, Patreon engagement, content QA, financial tracking, and strategic decisions require sustained daily/weekly effort — exactly the type of task the founder has identified as a vulnerability. Without an accountability partner, low cycles could cascade.
- **Mitigation**: Hire producer/accountability partner within 60 days (revenue-share 10-20%, not salary). Build 5-day content buffer. Create explicit "low energy protocol" where pipeline runs fully automated with pre-written community messages. Batch community work into 2x/week 30-minute sessions.
- **Owner**: Founder + Producer (once hired)

### Risk 4: Copyright/Fair Use for News Aggregation
- **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Detail**: Every episode synthesizes content from TechCrunch, The Verge, ArXiv, etc. Even editorial synthesis (not verbatim repackaging) may face DMCA claims. YouTube's Content ID system is aggressive and favors claimants.
- **Mitigation**: Never use original article text verbatim. Transform all content through editorial analysis and opinion. Add original "deep whisper" commentary. Consult IP attorney before launch ($500-1,500). Budget $3,600-$12,700 for initial legal setup including content usage strategy.
- **Owner**: Founder + IP Attorney

### Risk 5: Daily Format Fatigue
- **Severity**: MEDIUM-HIGH
- **Detail**: Daily content is the highest-churn format on YouTube. Even successful daily channels experience periodic audience erosion. Without deliberate format variation, viewer retention will decay after the novelty period (60-90 days).
- **Mitigation**: Build format variation from Day 1: Friday specials, monthly community episodes, quarterly "season" refreshes. Maintain a "format freshness" metric. Strategic 1-week breaks per quarter with pre-recorded "best of" content. Character development over time (callbacks, running jokes, evolving opinions).
- **Owner**: Founder + Producer

---

## 4. CROSS-SKILL INSIGHTS

### Reinforcing Signals
- **Bootstrap is correct**: Fundraising (92%), Finance (78%), and Business Model (72%) all converge — VC would be actively harmful. $2,200/month costs + freelance backstop = infinite runway.
- **Character IS the moat**: Marketing, Customer Success, Competitive Intelligence, and Product all identify the AI host as the primary retention/differentiation mechanism. Character bible in Month 1 is non-negotiable.
- **Producer hire is the #1 priority**: Operations, Customer Success, Fundraising, and Finance all flag this. Revenue-share structure recommended over salary.
- **9-month competitive window**: Competitive Intelligence estimates this window before copycats can replicate the format. First-mover advantage in format + character IP is the play.
- **Multi-revenue from Day 1**: Finance, Business Model, and GTM all say launch Patreon at Month 2 and pursue sponsorships at 10K subscribers. Don't depend on AdSense alone.

### Contradictions Found
- **Idea Validation (PIVOT) vs Finance (GO)**: Financial risk is low, but audience risk is unvalidated. **Resolution**: Both are right. Build fast, test with 10 episodes, then decide.
- **Product (MVP doesn't need avatar) vs Customer Success (character is #1 retention)**: **Resolution**: Start with a high-quality fixed character render to validate concept, invest in dynamic avatar after audience confirmation.
- **Growth targets conflict**: Founder wants 50K views by Month 3; Finance projects 15K. **Resolution**: Use 15K as the realistic target. 50K is aspirational.

### Information Gaps
- No data on whether ASMR + tech news crossover audience actually exists at meaningful scale
- ElevenLabs and HeyGen quality at daily production pace is untested
- YouTube's stance on AI-generated news content may shift
- Voice actress availability and batch recording quality is unknown
- Patreon conversion rates for this specific audience intersection are speculative

---

## 5. 90-DAY ACTION PLAN

### Month 1: Validate & Build (Theme: "Prove the Format")
- **Week 1-2**: Build minimal pipeline (Stages 1-3 only: ingest, script, voice). Use ElevenLabs for voice. Simple static background images, not full avatar rendering. Produce first 5 test episodes.
- **Week 3-4**: Publish 5 more test episodes. Measure: avg view duration, like ratio, subscriber conversion, comment sentiment. Create AI host character bible. Set up Patreon page (3 tiers: $5/$15/$50). Open business checking account (Mercury/Novo).
- **Key milestone**: 10 episodes published. Decision gate: if avg view duration >50% and any organic growth signal, proceed to Month 2. If not, pivot format before building full pipeline.

### Month 2: Automate & Grow (Theme: "Build the Machine")
- **Week 5-6**: Build remaining pipeline stages (4-7: video generation, thumbnails, publishing, analytics). Integrate HeyGen/Hedra for avatar. Launch YouTube Shorts/Reels distribution. Begin Reddit engagement (r/ASMR, r/artificial).
- **Week 7-8**: Full autonomous daily publishing operational. Launch Patreon with first exclusive content. Begin producer/accountability partner search. Set up Wave for bookkeeping. Auto-transfer 30% of all revenue to tax savings.
- **Key milestone**: Pipeline running autonomously with <1hr/week founder time. First Patreon supporters.

### Month 3: Optimize & Scale (Theme: "Find the Audience")
- **Week 9-10**: Analyze 60 days of data. Which stories get highest retention? Which locations get most comments? Optimize content selection algorithm. Implement format variations (Friday specials). Active community building.
- **Week 11-12**: Hire producer/accountability partner (revenue-share structure). Begin sponsorship outreach pipeline if approaching 5K subscribers. First monthly financial review: actual vs projected costs.
- **Key milestone**: 3,000+ subscribers. Producer hired. Format validated with audience data. Clear growth trajectory established.

---

## 6. BUSINESS MODEL & UNIT ECONOMICS

- **Model**: Multi-stream content monetization (AdSense + Patreon + Sponsorships + Affiliate + Character IP)
- **Pricing**: Patreon tiers at $5 (community access), $15 (exclusive content + Discord), $50 (co-creation + early access). Sponsorships $500-$1K initially, scaling to $1-5K/segment.
- **Cost per episode**: $73 all-in (LLM API $25 + avatar $30 + voice $15 + hosting $3)
- **Revenue per episode at Month 12**: $243 (AdSense $70 + Patreon $41 + Sponsorship $114 + Affiliate $18)
- **Margin per episode at scale**: 70%
- **Break-even**: Month 9 (base case) at ~200K monthly views
- **Monthly operating costs**: $2,200 (nearly fixed — costs don't scale with viewership)
- **Y1 total revenue (base case)**: ~$20K | **Y1 total costs**: ~$26K | **Y1 net**: -$6K
- **Y1 exit run rate**: $5,340/month ($64K annualized)
- **Content leverage**: 250+ episode back catalog generates compounding passive AdSense (20-30% of total by Month 12)

---

## 7. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

- **Motion**: Content-led growth (product IS the content)
- **Primary Channels**: YouTube Shorts/Reels (top-of-funnel acquisition) + Reddit (r/ASMR, r/artificial, r/singularity — authentic engagement, not spam)
- **First 1,000 Subscribers**:
  1. Post first 10 episodes with SEO-optimized titles ("AI News ASMR", "Whispered Tech Briefing")
  2. Cut 30-second Shorts from each episode — these are the primary discovery mechanism
  3. Share authentically on Reddit with genuine framing
  4. Cross-post to TikTok and Instagram Reels
  5. Engage in ASMR and AI communities as a participant, not a promoter
- **Launch Plan**:
  - Pre-launch: None needed. Just publish.
  - Launch: 10 test episodes in Week 1-2
  - Post-launch: Shorts blitz, Reddit engagement, community tab activation
- **Cold start solution**: Format novelty is the hook. ASMR + tech news has never been done — the concept itself is shareworthy.

## 8. PRODUCT ROADMAP

### MVP (Weeks 1-2)
- Automated news ingestion from RSS/APIs (Stage 1)
- Claude-generated 600-700 word scripts (Stage 2)
- ElevenLabs voice synthesis (Stage 3, Path B)
- Static exotic backdrop images (simplified Stage 4)
- Manual YouTube upload with basic metadata
- **No avatar rendering yet** — validate concept with simpler visuals first

### V1.0 (Weeks 3-6)
- Full HeyGen/Hedra avatar rendering (Stage 4)
- Automated thumbnail generation (Stage 5)
- YouTube Data API auto-publishing at 9 PM (Stage 6)
- Analytics feedback loop (Stage 7)
- Auto-cut Shorts/Reels from each episode
- Voice actress integration (Stage 3, Path A)

### V1.1 (Month 3+)
- Format variations (Friday specials, community episodes)
- Patreon-exclusive extended content
- Discord bot integration
- A/B testing on thumbnails and titles
- Character development system (callbacks, personality evolution)

### V2.0 (Month 6+)
- Multi-platform simultaneous publishing (TikTok, Instagram)
- AI-powered comment response drafting
- Sponsor integration automation
- Content performance prediction model

**North Star Metric**: Weekly Active Viewers (viewers who watch 3+ episodes per week). This measures habit formation — the core behavior that drives all revenue streams.

---

## 9. FUNDRAISE ASSESSMENT

- **Ready to raise?**: NO — and should not raise
- **Recommended strategy**: Bootstrap with freelance income backstop
- **Why not VC**: $2,200/month costs with freelance coverage = infinite runway. VC would impose growth timelines incompatible with ADHD/cyclothymia management. VCs need 100x returns; this business targets $400K-$1M Y3 — excellent lifestyle business, terrible VC investment. More money does not equal proportionally more views.
- **If capital needed later**: Revenue-based financing (Clearco, Spotter) after 6+ months of consistent 100K+ monthly views. No equity dilution.
- **Cash buffer needed**: $8-10K set aside before starting pipeline build
- **Freelance transition rule**: Do NOT reduce freelancing until Soft Report generates 3 consecutive months of revenue exceeding operating costs + 50% of living expenses

---

## 10. LEGAL CHECKLIST

- **Entity**: LLC (single-member) in New York. Elect S-Corp when net income exceeds $40K/year.
- **Immediate actions**:
  - [ ] Form LLC before publishing first episode ($200 NY filing)

## 12. WHAT COULD KILL THIS

### 1. YouTube Policy Change on AI Content
YouTube could demonetize, derank, or require intrusive disclosures on AI-generated content at any time. This is an existential, uncontrollable risk. The entire business sits on a single platform whose rules can change overnight. **Mitigation**: Diversify to owned channels (Patreon, email list, Discord) as fast as possible. Never let YouTube AdSense exceed 40% of total revenue.

### 2. The Audience Doesn't Exist
The assumption that ASMR enthusiasts want tech news (or vice versa) may be wrong. 50M ASMR searches + millions of AI news viewers ≠ a meaningful intersection. The crossover audience could be tiny. **Mitigation**: The 10-episode test in Month 1 is designed to answer this before significant investment. If avg view duration is below 40% across 10 episodes, the crossover isn't working.

### 3. Founder Burns Out Before Break-Even
Solo founder with ADHD/cyclothymia running a daily content operation for 9+ months before break-even. Even with automation, community management, financial tracking, sponsorship sales, and strategic decisions require sustained effort. A bad cyclothymia cycle during a critical growth period could stall everything. **Mitigation**: Producer hire within 60 days is non-negotiable. 5-day content buffer. Low-energy protocol. But ultimately, this risk cannot be fully mitigated — only managed.

**Y1 Totals**: Revenue $20K | Costs $26K | Net Loss -$6K | Exit run rate $5,340/mo ($64K annualized)

### Three Scenarios

| Scenario | Probability | Break-Even | Y1 Revenue | Y1 Exit Monthly | Y2 Revenue | Y3 Revenue |
|----------|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:---------------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| **Upside** | 20% | Month 6 | $35K | $8,500/mo | $150K-$240K | $500K-$1M+ |
| **Base** | 50% | Month 9 | $20K | $5,340/mo | $96K-$240K | $300K-$960K |
| **Downside** | 30% | Month 14 | $8K | $2,100/mo | $40K-$80K | $100K-$300K |

**Upside**: Viral moment in Month 3-4, ASMR+tech niche takes off faster than expected, early sponsorship interest.

**Base**: Steady organic growth, format finds its audience, typical YouTube channel growth trajectory.

**Downside**: Slow growth, algorithm doesn't favor AI content, crossover doesn't click. Founder subsidizes ~$2K/month from freelance for 14 months. Total investment ~$28K before break-even. Still viable as a side project generating some income.

### Freelance Transition Milestones

| Phase | Soft Report Revenue | Timeline | Action |
|-------|:-------------------:|:--------:|--------|
| Full Freelance | $0-$2,200/mo | Months 1-8 | Maintain full freelance. SR runs autonomously. |
| Reduce 25% | $2,200-$4,000/mo | Months 9-12 | Free up time for sponsorship sales, community. |
| Reduce 50% | $4,000-$6,000/mo | Months 12-18 | SR + remaining freelance covers everything. |
| Full-Time SR | $8,000+/mo | Months 18-24 | Quit freelancing. Requires 3 months of stable $8K+. |

### Key Financial Rule
Do NOT reduce freelancing until The Soft Report generates **3 consecutive months** of revenue exceeding operating costs + 50% of living expenses. The freelance income is a strategic asset that eliminates startup death clock pressure.
