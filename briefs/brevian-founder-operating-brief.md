# ValiBjorn Founder Operating Brief
## Brevian — Privilege-Protected AI Legal Intelligence Platform
Generated: 2026-02-10 | Run #8 | 13 Agents

---

## VERDICT: GO_CONDITIONAL
**Confidence: 67%**

Brevian occupies genuine white space — no one offers privilege-protected AI case analysis to individual litigants. The founder has exceptional market fit (built CaseBase, personal litigation experience, deep technical capability). However, the entire business depends on one unresolved legal question that **all 13 agents flagged**: whether the Kovel arrangement can scale to SaaS. Spend $2-5K on a legal ethics opinion before investing another dollar or hour. If Kovel validates, this is a strong GO. If it doesn't, the Arizona ABS structure may offer a viable alternative path.

## 1. IDEA SCORECARD

| Dimension | Score (1-10) | Key Finding |
|-----------|:---:|-------------|
| Problem Severity | 6 | Real but latent — litigants don't know their AI chats are discoverable until it's too late |
| Market Size | 8 | Legal AI market $2.7-4.2B by 2027; 10-15M pro se appearances/year in US |
| Founder-Market Fit | 9 | Built CaseBase prototype + personal litigation experience + deep technical skills — rare triple |
| Competitive Advantage | 8 | Privilege-as-moat is structural, not replicable by pure-tech competitors |
| Business Model Viability | 5 | Kovel cost ($50-100/customer/mo) compresses margins below SaaS benchmarks at $199/mo |
| Unit Economics | 5 | Gross margin 47-63% (below 70% SaaS benchmark); breakeven at 12-16 customers |
| Distribution Feasibility | 7 | Fear-based content marketing ("your ChatGPT logs are discoverable") is compelling and free |
| Product Buildability | 8 | CaseBase proves 60-70% of core engine; productization is standard SaaS infrastructure |
| Fundraise Readiness | 4 | Solo founder with unvalidated legal thesis — not VC-ready until Kovel validates + first customers |
| Legal/Regulatory Risk | 4 | Kovel untested at SaaS scale; UPL risk in multiple states; patchwork jurisdiction compliance |
| Team Readiness | 5 | Solo founder can build and launch; maxes out at ~20 customers without first hire |
| Timing | 7 | Legal AI validated by massive funding; regulatory pressure on AI disclosure; open-source models maturing |

**Overall Score: 76/120**

## 2. THE BUSINESS IN ONE PAGE

**Problem**: Millions of litigants use ChatGPT/Claude to analyze their cases, unknowingly creating discoverable evidence that opposing counsel can subpoena. No privilege-protected AI analysis exists for individual litigants at any price.

**Solution**: AI-powered case document analysis (pattern detection, behavioral trends, factual chronologies) wrapped in attorney-client privilege via Kovel arrangement + local inference ensuring data never touches third-party servers.

**Customer**: Pro se litigants in active family law cases (divorce/custody) who are already using AI tools and have large document collections.

**Insight**: Everyone is selling AI capabilities; nobody is selling privilege protection. The Kovel arrangement is established case law (1961) used routinely by accountants — applying it to legal tech SaaS is novel but defensible.

**Model**: B2C SaaS subscription ($199/mo + $399 setup fee). B2B expansion ($499-999/seat/mo) deferred to Phase 2.

**Positioning**: For individual litigants with large case files who are using ChatGPT to analyze their cases, Brevian is privilege-protected legal AI that ensures your case analysis cannot be subpoenaed. Unlike ChatGPT and other AI tools whose chat logs are discoverable evidence, Brevian processes everything under attorney-client privilege with local inference.

## 3. CRITICAL RISKS (Top 5)

**Risk 1: Kovel Arrangement Doesn't Scale for SaaS**
- **Severity**: FATAL — if this fails, the entire business model collapses
- **Mitigation**: Legal ethics opinion ($2-5K) before all other investment. Have Arizona ABS as fallback structure.
- **Owner**: Founder (engage legal ethics attorney Week 1)

**Risk 2: Solo Founder Capacity Ceiling**
- **Severity**: HIGH — 8 of 13 agents flagged this
- **Mitigation**: Target 10-20 customers in 90 days (not 100). First hire should be CS, not engineering. Automate onboarding aggressively.
- **Owner**: Founder

**Risk 3: Structural Churn from Case Lifecycle**
- **Severity**: HIGH — litigation ends = customer cancels, capping LTV at $1,100-1,800
- **Mitigation**: Model 10-15% monthly churn. Offer $49/mo archive tier post-resolution. Target custody cases (longest duration). Push annual pricing ($1,990/yr).
- **Owner**: Founder + Product

**Risk 4: UPL Risk from Product Language**
- **Severity**: HIGH — criminal offense in some states
- **Mitigation**: All outputs framed as "factual chronologies" never "case analysis." Attorney-review all copy. Persistent disclaimers. Constrain AI from providing legal opinions.
- **Owner**: Founder + Legal Ethics Attorney

**Risk 5: Local Inference Quality Gap**
- **Severity**: MEDIUM — users who've experienced GPT-4/Claude may be disappointed
- **Mitigation**: Benchmark local models against cloud APIs on real legal documents before launch. Position as "privilege-protected" not "best AI." Have hybrid architecture ready as fallback.
- **Owner**: Founder

## 4. CROSS-SKILL INSIGHTS

### Reinforcing Signals
- **Founder-market fit is exceptional** — Idea Validation, Product, and Operations all scored this as the strongest signal. Built CaseBase + personal litigation experience + technical skills is a rare combination.
- **Fear-based acquisition is powerful** — Marketing, GTM, and Sales converge on "your ChatGPT logs are discoverable" as the primary hook. It's factually true, emotionally compelling, and inherently shareable.
- **B2C-first is correct** — GTM, Sales, Operations, and Business Model unanimously say don't try B2B simultaneously. Nurture attorney interest passively.
- **Category-creating positioning works** — "Privilege-protected AI" is unoccupied territory with an estimated 12-18 month window before incumbents react.

### Contradictions Found
- **Business Model says $199/mo is barely viable** vs **Marketing says privilege justifies premium pricing** → Resolution: Test $299/mo. Multiple agents suggest $199 is too low if privilege is the real moat.
- **GTM targets 100 customers in 90 days** vs **Operations says solo founder maxes at ~20** → Resolution: Target 10-20 customers. The GTM plan was aspirational; Operations is realistic.
- **Fundraising suggests B2B-first for higher ACV** vs **Sales/GTM recommend B2C-first for self-serve** → Resolution: B2C-first is correct for solo founder. B2B requires sales cycles the founder can't afford yet.
- **Legal says 4-6 months for compliant launch** vs **Founder wants 90-day launch** → Resolution: 90-day beta with first customers is feasible; full legal compliance is a parallel track. Consider B2B-only first (law firm's own privilege covers data) while B2C legal infrastructure is built.

### Information Gaps
- Zero customer interviews — all analysis is theoretical until real buyers validate the privilege value proposition
- Kovel scalability at SaaS scale — no precedent exists; requires formal legal ethics opinion
- Local inference quality benchmarks — not yet compared against cloud models for legal document analysis
- Actual Kovel attorney cost structure — flat retainer vs per-customer not negotiated
- Willingness-to-pay for privilege specifically (vs. AI quality) — untested

---

## 5. 90-DAY ACTION PLAN

### Month 1: Validate or Die
- **Week 1-2**: Engage legal ethics attorney for Kovel opinion ($2-5K). This is the single highest-ROI spend.
- **Week 1-2**: Set up landing page with "ChatGPT logs are discoverable" hook + waitlist. Target 200+ signups.
- **Week 1-4**: Begin Reddit community engagement in r/divorce, r/familylaw, r/custody — educational posts only, not promotional.
- **Week 2-4**: Conduct 10-15 Mom Test interviews with pro se litigants and 10 with small firm attorneys.
- **Week 3-4**: Benchmark local inference (Kimi K2, Llama 3.1) vs. cloud models on real legal documents.
- **Key milestone**: Kovel ethics opinion received; 200+ waitlist signups; 20+ customer interviews completed.

### Month 2: Build the Privilege Layer (IF Kovel validates)
- **Week 5-6**: Multi-tenant architecture with privilege isolation (Supabase RLS + tenant isolation).
- **Week 5-6**: Adapt CaseBase ingestion pipeline for user-facing document upload.
- **Week 6-7**: Kovel onboarding flow (e-sign engagement agreement, plain-English UX).
- **Week 7-8**: Integrate local inference model; billing via Stripe ($199/mo + $399 setup).
- **Week 8**: Beta launch with 5 users from waitlist. Manual onboarding of each.
- **Key milestone**: Working MVP with privilege layer; 5 active beta users uploading documents.

### Month 3: First Customers
- **Week 9-10**: Convert beta users to paid. Activate waitlist for broader launch. Target 10-15 paying customers.
- **Week 10-11**: Manual onboarding of each customer (product research + testimonial opportunity).
- **Week 11-12**: First case studies (anonymized). Begin passive B2B attorney pipeline nurturing.
- **Week 12**: Review unit economics with real data. Adjust pricing if needed.
- **Key milestone**: 10-20 paying customers; $2K-4K MRR; real Kovel cost data; first testimonials.

## 6. BUSINESS MODEL & UNIT ECONOMICS

- **Model**: B2C SaaS subscription + one-time setup fee
- **Pricing**: $199/mo + $399 setup fee (consider testing $299/mo)
- **LTV**: $1,527 (12-month avg lifetime × $94 gross profit/mo + $399 setup)
- **CAC**: $150-250 blended (content-driven; avoid paid ads at this stage)
- **LTV:CAC**: 6:1 to 10:1 (strong if CAC stays organic)
- **Gross Margin**: 47-63% realistic (below 70% SaaS benchmark — Kovel cost is the culprit)
- **Payback Period**: 1.6-2.7 months (excellent)
- **Critical path to 70% margin**: Negotiate flat Kovel retainer ($1K-1.5K/mo) that amortizes across growing customer base. At 200 customers, per-customer Kovel cost drops to $5-10/mo.

---

## 7. GO-TO-MARKET STRATEGY

- **Motion**: Community-led + fear-based content marketing (not product-led or sales-led)
- **Primary Channel**: Reddit (r/divorce, r/familylaw, r/custody) + SEO ("AI chat subpoena" keyword cluster)
- **First 100 Customers**: Weeks 1-4 education → Weeks 5-8 convert waitlist to beta → Weeks 9-12 paid customers + referrals
- **Launch Plan**: Pre-launch (waitlist + content) → Invite-only beta (5-10 users) → Early access (10-20 users) → Open registration
- **Referral mechanic**: "Give a month, get a month" — litigants naturally warn other litigants

---

---

## 9. FUNDRAISE ASSESSMENT

- **Ready to raise?**: Not yet — must validate Kovel structure + get first customers
- **Recommended stage**: Bootstrap for 6 months, then assess
- **Key gaps to close first**: (1) Kovel legal validation, (2) 20+ paying customers, (3) real unit economics data, (4) competitive intelligence on Harvey/CoCounsel response
- **Pitch deck strength**: Strong narrative ("privilege-as-moat" is a compelling investor thesis) but unproven thesis
- **When ready**: Pre-seed $250K-500K to fund attorney network + marketing + first hire. Alternatively, revenue-fund if unit economics work.

---

## 10. LEGAL CHECKLIST

- **Entity**: Delaware C-Corp (fundraising optionality) + Arizona ABS for legal services delivery
- **Immediate actions**:
  - Engage legal ethics attorney for Kovel opinion ($2-5K) — Week 1
  - File 83(b) election within 30 days of share issuance
  - Reserve 10-15% option pool for future hires/advisors
- **Before launch**:
  - Kovel attorney partner signed and engaged
  - Terms of Service, Privacy Policy, engagement letters drafted and attorney-reviewed
  - All marketing copy reviewed for UPL and misleading privilege claims
  - Tech E&O + Cyber liability insurance procured (~$5-13K/year)
- **Regulatory considerations**:
  - UPL varies by state — launch in permissive jurisdictions first (AZ, UT, CA)
  - All AI outputs must be "factual chronologies" never "legal advice"
  - Conflict checking system required before scale

## 12. WHAT COULD KILL THIS

The honest assessment. Top 3 existential threats:

1. **Kovel arrangement is invalidated for SaaS at scale.** If a court or ethics opinion says one attorney cannot provide a privilege umbrella for hundreds of SaaS customers, the entire moat evaporates. Probability: 30-40%. Early warning: ethics attorney raises concerns. Escape route: Arizona ABS structure or B2B-only model.

2. **Harvey AI or Thomson Reuters/CoCounsel adds a privilege layer.** A well-funded incumbent could add "enterprise privilege mode" within 12-18 months, neutralizing Brevian's differentiation for the B2B segment. Probability: 25-35%. Early warning: competitor job postings for "legal privilege" or "Kovel" expertise. Escape route: B2C focus where incumbents don't play; community and brand moat.

3. **A data breach waives privilege for ALL customers simultaneously.** Unlike a law firm breach where privilege typically survives, a Kovel arrangement breach could be used to argue the entire structure was inadequate. This is a correlated, catastrophic risk. Probability: 5-10% (low but devastating). Early warning: any security incident. Escape route: none — this must be prevented, not mitigated.
