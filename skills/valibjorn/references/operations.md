## HIRING SYSTEM

### Job Description Framework

Structure every JD as:
```
[Role Title] | [Company] | [Location] | [Remote Policy]

About Us: 2-3 sentences (what, for whom, why it matters, stage, funding, notable investors/customers)
The Role: What this person owns and accomplishes (outcomes, not tasks). Why this role matters now.
What You'll Do: 3-5 outcome-focused responsibilities
What We're Looking For: 5-7 max essentials + nice-to-haves
Compensation: Salary range + equity range + key benefits
```

Rules:
- Lead with outcomes ("Own the customer onboarding experience" not "Build onboarding flows")
- Be specific about stage ("0-1 experience", "scaling from $1M to $10M ARR")
- Always include salary range
- Keep requirements to 5-7 items max (long lists reduce diversity)

### Role-Specific Criteria (High-Weight)

**Engineer:** Coding ability, system design, problem-solving, handles ambiguous requirements, learns quickly, takes ownership, full-stack capability, ships quickly
**PM:** Customer insight, prioritization/judgment, spec writing, ships products, handles ambiguity, cross-functional collaboration, clarity of thought
**Sales (AE):** Discovery/qualification, demo/presentation, closing ability, coachability, resilience/grit, self-motivation, quota attainment history
**Ops/CoS:** Project management, problem-solving, communication, organization/systems thinking, comfort with ambiguity, ownership mentality, prioritization, decision-making with incomplete data

### Interview Question Banks

**Engineer Technical:** Walk through a system you built (key decisions). Design [relevant system]. Hard-to-find bug debugging story.
**Engineer Behavioral:** Requirements kept changing. Shipped something not proud of. Pushed back on product decision.
**Engineer Stage Fit:** 10-person vs 100-person company difference. Built without clear specs. "Good enough" to ship threshold.

**PM Customer Insight:** Discovered non-obvious customer need. Stay close to customers process. Decision based on research.
**PM Prioritization:** Framework for what to build next. Killed a feature/project. Balance customer requests vs strategy.
**PM Execution:** Shipped product end-to-end. Launch that didn't go as planned. Working with engineering process.

**Sales Discovery:** Role-play qualification. Discovery call prep. Deal lost from poor qualification.
**Sales Closing:** Biggest deal closed. Handling "need to think about it." Rescued almost-lost deal.
**Sales Behavioral:** Missed quota quarter. Handling rejection. Managing large pipeline.

**Ops Project Mgmt:** Complex project management. Project off the rails. Competing priorities from multiple stakeholders.
**Ops Problem-Solving:** Messy operational problem solved. Built process from scratch. System vs manual threshold.
**Ops Startup Fit:** Attraction to X-person company. Outside job description. No clear direction.

### Process Rules
- Same questions for all candidates (enables comparison)
- Score immediately after interview (memory fades)
- Submit feedback before seeing others' scores (prevents groupthink)
- Focus on evidence not impressions ("They described X" not "They seemed smart")
- Define scorecard criteria before posting job
- Hold debrief only after all scores submitted

### Red Flags: Generic answers, blames others, can't explain decisions, misaligned motivation, poor questions
### Green Flags: Specific examples, owns failures, shows curiosity, relevant preparation, consistent narrative

## OKR FRAMEWORK (Liz Wessel / Google Method)

### Formula
```
I will [OBJECTIVE] as measured by [KEY RESULTS]
```

**Objective:** Qualitative, inspiring, time-bound. Formula: Verb + what you're going to do + so that/in order to
**Key Result:** Quantitative, measurable. Formula: Verb + what you're tracking + from X to Y
**Key Initiative (optional):** Actions to achieve KRs, measured as % completed

### Rules
- 3 objectives max per company/team/individual per cycle
- 1-3 key results per objective
- KRs must be quantifiable with numbers
- Revisit frequently (don't set and forget)
- KRs are NOT task lists ("launch feature X" is wrong)
- Avoid vague objectives ("Be the best")
- Don't conflate KPIs (what you track) with OKRs (what you're trying to change)
- If a KPI underperforms, create an OKR to address it

### Necessary & Sufficient Test
1. Are ALL Key Results necessary to achieve the Objective?
2. Will accomplishing ALL Key Results be sufficient to achieve the Objective?

### OKR Superpowers Checklist: Focus (what can be eliminated?), Alignment (who are stakeholders?), Tracking (can we measure?), Transparency (where are bottlenecks?), Stretch (propelling business forward?)

### Stage-Based Examples

**Pre-PMF:**
- Validate PMF: 100 weekly active users, 40% 7-day retention, 10 users willing to pay, NPS>40
- Learn customer needs: 50 interviews, top 3 must-have features validated by usage, time-to-value 3d->1d
- Build lean team: Hire 2 engineers who ship week 1, deploy daily, <24h idea-to-feedback cycle

**Post-PMF/Scaling:**
- Hit $10M ARR: Net retention >110%, pipeline $5M->$15M, sales cycle 45->30 days, close rate >25%
- World-class CX: NPS 35->50, time-to-value 14d->3d, churn <5% monthly, support response <4h
- Scale team preserving culture: Hire 10 in <45d avg, 90% rate onboarding 4+/5, regrettable attrition <5%, eNPS>50

### Team-Level OKR Templates
- **Engineering:** Uptime 99.9%, p95 latency 500ms->200ms, zero critical bugs 30d, ship 12 features; PR review 48h->24h, deploy weekly->daily, bug fix 5d->2d, 80% test coverage
- **Sales:** Close $2M new ARR, $8M qualified pipeline, avg deal >$50K, 100% reps at quota; document playbook, cycle 60->45d, demo-to-close >30%, forecast accuracy <10%
- **Product:** Ship v2 by date, 50% adopt new features in 30d, feature NPS>50, support tickets <10/wk; 30 customer interviews, reduce backlog 40%, 90% features validated pre-build
- **Marketing:** Traffic 10K->30K, 500 MQLs, 5% visitor-to-signup, 3 industry mentions; 12 blog posts, 5K newsletter subs, 2 speaking events
- **CS:** Gross retention >95%, net retention >115%, expansion >$500K, 50% green health score; CSAT >4.5, first response <2h, resolution <24h

### OKR Cadence
| Stage | Cadence | Focus |
|-------|---------|-------|
| Pre-PMF | Monthly or 6-week cycles | Learning velocity, user feedback |
| Post-PMF | Quarterly | Growth metrics, retention |
| Scaling | Quarterly + annual goals | Revenue, team, market expansion |

### Setting Ritual
- Week -2: Leadership defines company OKRs, shares context
- Week -1: Teams draft team OKRs (aligned to company), individuals draft personal OKRs (aligned to team)
- Week 0: Review, finalize, publish company-wide, kickoff meeting

### Tracking Ritual
- Weekly: Update values, flag at-risk, check-in at standups
- Bi-weekly: Deeper review, discuss blockers, re-forecast confidence
- Monthly: Company-wide check-in, leadership reviews, adjust resources

### Closing Ritual
- Week 12: Final scoring 0-100% per KR. Average KR scores = Objective score. 70%+ = success (stretch goals)
- Week 13: Retrospective, learnings, begin next quarter setting

### Status: On Track (>70% confidence), At Risk (50-70%), Off Track (<50%)

### Anti-Patterns: Too many OKRs (>3 objectives), KRs are tasks, no baseline, set-and-forget, sandbagging (should be stretch), using for performance reviews (kills safety), misaligned (don't ladder up), all committed (need mix of committed/aspirational), no owner, changing mid-quarter without major pivot

## INVESTOR UPDATE TEMPLATE

### Monthly Update (Concise Format - Recommended)
```
Subject: [Company] Update - [Month Year]

ASKS
- [Specific: "intro to [Person] at [Company]", "referrals for senior engineers with [skill]"]

GOING WELL
- Hiring: +X FT (names/roles)
- Product: Launched [feature] - [link]
- [Metric]: X,XXX (+Y% m/m vs Z% target)

NOT GOING WELL
- [Metric]: X,XXX (+Y% m/m vs Z% target) - [1 sentence why + what doing]
- [Challenge]: [Brief description + plan]

COMPANY HEALTH
- Cash: $X.XM | Burn: $XXXK/mo | Runway: X months | Team: X people (Y FT, Z contractors)

PRIORITIES (Next 30 Days)
1. [Priority]: [What and why]
2. [Priority]: [What and why]
3. [Priority]: [What and why]

SHOUT OUTS
- [Person/firm] for [specific help]
```

### Quarterly Report (Detailed)
Executive Summary (3-5 sentences: performance vs plan, wins, challenges, next). Quarterly Scorecard table (Metric | Actual | Target | YTD). Business Highlights by category (Revenue, Product, Customers, Team). Challenges & Risks (Impact, Mitigation, Help needed). Financial table (Revenue, COGS, Gross Margin, OpEx, Net Burn | Actual | Budget | Variance). Cash position, runway, next raise timeline. Next Quarter Priorities (with OKRs). Specific Asks.

### Rules
- Lead with asks (make it easy to help)
- Be honest about what's not working (builds trust)
- Always include runway
- Keep it short (bullet points, 5-10 min read max)
- Send consistently (monthly builds muscle memory)
- Send monthly updates first week of following month
- Send quarterly reports within 2 weeks of quarter end
- Send bad news immediately (don't wait for scheduled update)

### Metrics by Stage
- **Pre-Seed/Pre-PMF:** Users, engagement/retention, qualitative feedback, learning velocity, runway
- **Seed/Finding PMF:** MRR/ARR, customer count, retention/churn, NPS, CAC, runway
- **Series A/Scaling:** ARR growth rate, net revenue retention, CAC:LTV, gross margin, sales efficiency, runway, team metrics

### Investor Red Flags: Inconsistent reporting, only good news, no asks, runway surprise, vague metrics, blame external factors, radio silence

### Good Asks vs Bad Asks
Bad: "Help with hiring" / "Introductions to customers"
Good: "Intro to [Person] at [Company] - they're our ICP and I saw you're connected" / "Referrals for senior engineers with [skill] - here's our JD [link]" / "30 min to discuss [decision] - choosing between [A] and [B]"

## OPERATIONAL ANTI-PATTERNS

**Hiring:** 15+ requirements in JD, no structured interview process (gut-feel), not checking references, hiring too senior too early (they need structure you don't have), outsourcing founder-led sales too early

**OKRs:** >3 objectives, KRs that are tasks not outcomes, set-and-forget, no connection between company and team OKRs, treating OKRs as performance reviews

**Board:** Only sending updates when fundraising, hiding bad news, no consistent format, not asking for specific help, running overtime with no discussion time

---

## DIAGNOSTIC ROUTING

| Signal | Route |

| "Write job description", "interview process", "hiring plan" | Hiring System |
| "Set OKRs", "quarterly goals", "team alignment" | OKR Framework |
| "Board deck", "investor update", "board meeting" | Board Management |
| New to operations, scaling team | Start with Hiring |
