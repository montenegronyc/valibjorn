## 2. BUSINESS MODEL TYPES (8 Core Archetypes)

### SaaS (Software as a Service)
- **Description:** Cloud-based subscription software
- **Key Metrics:** MRR/ARR, Growth Rate, Net Revenue Retention (NRR), CAC
- **Best For:** B2B software with recurring value
- **Insights:** Recurring revenue; ideally annual contracts; growth via direct sales, self-serve, or both
- **Examples:** Adobe, Zoom, Slack, Salesforce

### Transactional
- **Description:** Facilitate transactions, take a cut
- **Key Metrics:** GTV (Gross Transaction Value), Net Revenue (fees, often %), User Retention, CAC
- **Best For:** Fintech, payments
- **Insights:** One-time transactions, not recurring; high volume, low fee (1-3%); best have consistent revenue from high repeat usage
- **Examples:** Stripe, Coinbase, Wise

### Marketplace
- **Description:** Connect buyers and sellers, facilitate transactions
- **Key Metrics:** GMV, Net Revenue / Take Rate, Growth Rate, User Retention
- **Best For:** Platforms with network effects
- **Insights:** Chicken-and-egg problem at start; must scale supply and demand together; network effects drive exponential growth; often winner-take-all
- **Examples:** Airbnb, DoorDash, Etsy, eBay

### Subscription (Consumer)
- **Description:** Product/service on recurring basis, usually B2C
- **Key Metrics:** MRR/ARR, Growth Rate, User Retention, CAC
- **Best For:** Consumer products with habit/recurring value
- **Insights:** Lower price points, higher volume; growth via scalable self-serve channels
- **Examples:** Amazon Prime, ClassPass, Netflix

### Enterprise
- **Description:** Large fixed-term contracts to big companies (5K+ employees)
- **Key Metrics:** Bookings, Revenue, ACV (Annual Contract Value), Pipeline
- **Best For:** Complex B2B, long sales cycles
- **Insights:** Few customers, large deals ($100K+/yr); direct sales driven; paid pilots or LOIs; buyer often not end user; lumpy growth
- **Examples:** Workday, Salesforce, SAP

### Usage-Based
- **Description:** Pay-as-you-go based on consumption
- **Key Metrics:** Monthly Revenue (NOT recurring), Growth Rate, Revenue Retention, Gross Margin
- **Best For:** APIs, infrastructure, cloud
- **Insights:** Don't confuse with recurring; charge per API request, records, data, etc.; grow as customers grow; scales from startup to enterprise
- **Examples:** AWS, Twilio, Algolia

### E-commerce
- **Description:** Sell products online (own inventory, not marketplace)
- **Key Metrics:** Monthly Revenue, Growth Rate, Gross Margin / Unit Economics, CAC
- **Best For:** D2C brands, physical goods
- **Insights:** Keep 100% of sale; higher COGS = lower margins; products often commoditized; must excel at acquisition and unit economics
- **Examples:** Warby Parker, Amazon (retail)

### Advertising
- **Description:** Sell ads to monetize free users
- **Key Metrics:** DAU, MAU, User Retention (D1/7/30), CPM/CPC
- **Best For:** High-scale consumer apps
- **Insights:** Customer is advertiser, not user; need billions of impressions monthly; Registered Users is a vanity metric
- **Examples:** Facebook, Twitter/X, Reddit

### Hardtech / Bio / Moonshots (Bonus)
- **Metrics:** Milestones, signed contracts, LOIs
- **Insights:** Years to product; milestones de-risk tech; revenue often years away

**Selection Questions:**
1. Who pays? (End user, business, advertiser, both sides?)
2. How often do they pay? (One-time, recurring, per-use?)
3. What's the natural buying pattern? (Impulse, considered, enterprise?)
4. Where's the value? (Product, platform, network?)

| 44 | Robin Hood | Same product to "rich" at higher price than "poor" | Warby Parker, tiered pricing |
| 50 | Target the Poor | Product for base of pyramid; low price, high volume | Walmart, Aldi, Tata Nano |

### Pattern Application Rules
- Most successful companies combine multiple patterns (Netflix: Subscription + Long Tail + Direct Selling; Amazon: E-commerce + Marketplace + Long Tail + Cash Machine; Uber: Two-sided Market + Pay Per Use + Direct Selling)
- Ask: Which patterns fit customer buying behavior? Which create defensibility? Which can compound? Which do competitors NOT use?
- Innovate by transferring patterns across industries (Subscription from media to software = SaaS; Razor/blade from razors to printers to gaming consoles; Auction from art to advertising = Google Ads)

## 4. PRICING STRATEGY

### Three Foundational Approaches

| Strategy | Price Based On | Best For | Risk |
|----------|---------------|----------|------|
| **Value-Based** | Customer's perceived value | Differentiated products, clear ROI, complex B2B, premium positioning | Requires deep customer knowledge |
| **Cost-Plus** | Your costs + margin (Price = Cost x (1 + Markup%)) | Commodities, physical products with known COGS, quick initial pricing | Ignores willingness to pay; ceiling on profitability |
| **Competitive** | What competitors charge | Established markets, well-known alternatives | Race to bottom; commoditization |

**Selection Matrix:**
- Unique product, clear ROI = Value-based
- Commodity, price-sensitive market = Cost-plus or Competitive
- New category, no direct competitors = Value-based
- Established market, known alternatives = Competitive (with differentiation)
- Early stage, testing PMF = Simple pricing, iterate fast

### Value-Based Pricing Implementation

**Value Stick Framework:**
```
Willingness to Pay (WTP) ← Customer's max price
  CUSTOMER DELIGHT = WTP - Price
Price ← What customer pays
  FIRM MARGIN = Price - Cost
Cost ← Your cost to deliver
```

Key insight: Your pricing ceiling is the customer's alternative cost, not your internal costs.

**Steps:**
1. Understand customer value (outcomes, dollar value, alternative cost)
2. Segment by value (Enterprise=$500K value, SMB=$10K value; price accordingly)
3. Quantify value: Time saved/week x Hourly rate x 52 = Annual value. Price at 10-30% of value delivered
4. Test and iterate with real customers

### Cost-Plus Pricing
```
Minimum price = Cost to serve + Required margin
Optimal price = Based on value (usually higher)
```
Use as floor, not strategy. Limitations for SaaS: dev cost is upfront, marginal cost near-zero; ignores WTP.

### Competitive Pricing Positions

| Position | Price vs Competitor | Strategy |
|----------|---------------------|----------|
| Premium | +20-50% | Superior value justifies premium |
| Parity | +/-10% | Compete on features, not price |
| Value | -20-40% | Undercut with good-enough product |
| Disrupt | -50%+ | Different cost structure enables lower price |

**Analysis:** Map competitors (direct, indirect, alternative) -> Analyze pricing (price points, tiers, value metric, packaging) -> Find position (differentiation, underserved segments, price gaps)

### Pricing Models (SaaS/Subscription)

| Model | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| Per-seat | Simple, predictable | Limits adoption, gaming | Collaboration tools, CRMs (Slack, Salesforce) |
| Per-feature/Tiered | Natural upsell, captures segments | Complexity, cannibalization | Products with distinct feature sets (HubSpot, GitHub) |
| Usage-based | Aligns with value, scales naturally, low barrier | Revenue unpredictable, billing complexity | Infrastructure, APIs (AWS, Twilio, Stripe) |
| Flat-rate | Dead simple, no friction | Leaves money on table, doesn't scale | Simple products, early stage (Basecamp) |
| Freemium | Max top-of-funnel, viral potential | Conversion challenge (typical 2-5%, good 5-10%, excellent 10%+) | Wide market, viral products (Spotify, Dropbox) |
| Hybrid | Predictable base + usage upside | Complex pricing | Enterprise + self-serve (Snowflake, MongoDB Atlas) |

**Tier Structure Best Practice:**
- Free/Starter: Get users in (optional)
- Growth: Core value for SMB
- Pro: Advanced features for growth companies
- Enterprise: Custom, high-touch, compliance

### HOPE Framework (Value Metric Selection)

Score each candidate metric 1-5:

| Criterion | Question | Weight |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **H**igh value connection | Does it correlate to customer outcomes? | High |
| **O**bvious to customer | Is it familiar and predictable? | Medium |
| **P**redictable | Can customers forecast their usage? | Medium |
| **E**asy to implement | Can you measure and bill it? | Low |

Common value metrics by product type:
- CRM: contacts, users, features
- Email marketing: subscribers, emails sent
- Analytics: events tracked, users
- Infrastructure: compute hours, storage, API calls
- Payments: transactions, volume
- Communication: messages, seats

### Pricing Psychology
- **Anchoring:** Show highest tier first
- **Decoy Effect:** Add third option making target look better
- **Charm Pricing:** $99 vs $100 (significant psychological difference)
- **Annual Discount:** "2 months free" > "17% off" (same discount, better framing). Standard 10-20% discount
- **Price Endings:** $.99 = value; $.00 = premium

### Pricing Process
**Early Stage (Pre-PMF):** Start simple -> Price higher than you think -> Talk to every customer about price -> Iterate fast
**Growth Stage:** Segment by value -> Design tiers per segment -> Test on new customers first -> Communicate changes clearly -> Consider grandfathering
**When to raise:** Added significant value; win rates >50%; customers say you're underpriced; same price 12+ months; costs increased

### Pricing Sanity Checks
- Does price reflect value delivered?
- Can customers predict their bill?
- Is there a natural expansion path?
- Does pricing align with how customers budget?

## 5. UNIT ECONOMICS

### Core Formulas

```
CAC = Total Sales & Marketing Spend / New Customers Acquired

LTV = (ARPU x Gross Margin) / Monthly Churn Rate

LTV (with expansion) = (ARPU x Gross Margin x NRR) / Churn

LTV:CAC Ratio = LTV / CAC

CAC Payback (months) = CAC / (ARPU x Gross Margin)

Gross Margin = (Revenue - COGS) / Revenue

Monthly Customer Churn = Customers Lost / Starting Customers

Monthly Revenue Churn = MRR Lost / Starting MRR

NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Contraction - Churn) / Starting MRR

Customer Lifetime = 1 / Churn Rate

Contribution Margin = Revenue - Variable Costs
```

**CAC includes:** Paid ads, marketing team salaries, sales salaries + commissions, marketing tools, events, content creation. Calculate segmented CAC by channel and customer segment.

**SaaS COGS includes:** Hosting/infrastructure, customer support (direct), third-party software costs, payment processing fees.

### Benchmarks by Business Model

**B2B SaaS:**
| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| LTV:CAC | 3:1 to 4:1 |
| CAC Payback | <12 months |

**E-commerce / D2C:**
| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| CAC | < First order profit |
| Gross Margin | >30% |
| Contribution Margin | >15% |
| Repeat Purchase Rate | >40% |

**Enterprise:**
| Metric | Benchmark |
|--------|-----------|
| ACV | >$100K |

**Gross Margin Targets:**
- SaaS: 70-85%
- Marketplace: 60-80%
- E-commerce: 30-50%
- Services: 50-70%

**Churn Benchmarks:**

|--------|------|-------|---------------|
| Monthly churn | <3% | <2% | <1% |
| Annual churn | <10% | <7% | <5% |
| NRR | >100% | >110% | >120% |

### LTV:CAC Interpretation

| Ratio | Interpretation | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| <1:1 | Losing money on every customer | Fix immediately |
| 1:1-2:1 | Marginal/break-even | Needs optimization |
| 3:1 | Healthy, sustainable growth | Target zone |
| 3:1-5:1 | Strong unit economics | Optimal |
| >5:1 | May be underinvesting in growth | Consider scaling spend |

### CAC Payback Benchmarks

| Payback | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| <6 months | Excellent |
| 6-12 months | Good for SaaS |
| 12-18 months | Acceptable for enterprise |
| >18 months | Cash flow concern |

### Red Flags Table

| Problem | Diagnosis | Fixes |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| LTV:CAC < 1 | Losing money per customer | Raise prices, cut CAC, reduce churn |
| CAC Payback > 18mo | Cash flow risk | Improve conversion, raise prices |
| Gross Margin < 50% | Cost structure issue (not a software business) | Reduce COGS, automate support |
| Churn > 5%/month | Value/fit problem | Improve product, target better customers |
| CAC increasing | Channel saturation | Find new channels, improve conversion |
| LTV:CAC 1:1-2:1 | Dangerous, needs optimization | Raise prices, reduce churn, cut CAC |

### Improvement Strategies

**Improve LTV:** Add premium tiers, usage-based pricing, annual contracts, upsell/cross-sell; reduce churn via better onboarding, customer success, better PMF; increase expansion via usage growth features, seat expansion triggers, add-on products.

**Reduce CAC:** Optimize funnel, better targeting, sales enablement, PLG; lower CPL via SEO/content, referral programs, community, partnerships; double down on best channels, cut underperformers.

## 6. COMPETITIVE POSITIONING (April Dunford Method)

### The Five Components (FOLLOW THIS ORDER)

```
Competitive Alternatives -> Unique Attributes -> Value (So what?) -> Target Customer -> Market Category
```

### Step 1: List Competitive Alternatives
What would customers do if you didn't exist?
- Direct competitors (same product, same market)
- Indirect competitors (different product, same problem)
- Status quo (do nothing, ignore problem)
- Manual workarounds (spreadsheets, hire someone)

### Step 2: Identify Unique Attributes
What do you have that alternatives lack?
- Features, technology, delivery model, price, service, expertise
- Rules: Be specific (not "AI-powered" but "uses GPT-4 to auto-generate emails"); must be objectively true; alternatives must actually lack it

### Step 3: Map Attributes to Value
For each unique attribute:
- Attribute -> Benefit (what can customers DO?) -> Outcome (measurable result) -> Value (in their words)
- Express in customer outcomes, NOT features

### Step 4: Define Target Customer Characteristics
Who cares A LOT about your value? Think characteristics, not demographics:
- What situation are they in?
- What problem is urgent for them?
- What makes your value particularly important?
- Not: "Marketing managers at B2B companies." Yes: "Teams who have outgrown spreadsheets but can't afford enterprise tools."

### Step 5: Choose Market Category
What context makes your value obvious?
- **Existing category:** Compete in established market
- **Subcategory:** Carve out a niche of existing category
- **New category:** Create entirely new market (hardest, highest education cost)

Category affects: customer expectations, competitive set, pricing expectations, feature requirements.

### Three Positioning Styles

| Style | When to Use | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|
| Head-to-Head | You can genuinely beat the leader on their turf | Resource-intensive |
| Big Fish, Small Pond | Niche underserved by leaders | Market may be too small |
| Create New Category | Truly novel, no good comparison | Education cost is high |

### Porter's Competitive Strategies

| Strategy | How to Win | Examples | Risk |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| Cost Leadership | Lowest costs enable lowest prices (scale, efficiency, simpler product) | Walmart, Ryanair, IKEA | Race to bottom |
| Differentiation | Unique value justifies premium (quality, features, brand, experience) | Apple, Tesla, Salesforce | Premium may not sustain |
| Focus (Cost or Diff) | Narrow market served better than broad competitors | Rolls-Royce, specialty retailers | Niche may be too small |

WARNING: Trying both cost leadership AND differentiation usually fails. Pick one.

### Positioning Statement Template
```
For [target customer with specific characteristics]
Who [struggle with specific problem],
[Product Name] is a [market category]
That [delivers specific benefit/outcome].
Unlike [primary alternative],
Our product [key differentiator that matters to target customer].
```

### Common Positioning Anti-Patterns
1. **Features over Value:** "AI-powered analytics" -> "Know why customers churn before they leave"
2. **Too Broad:** "For businesses that want to grow" -> "For e-commerce teams reducing cart abandonment"
3. **Fake Differentiators:** "Easy to use" (everyone says this) -> "Set up in 5 minutes, no technical skills"
4. **Ignoring Competitive Context:** Positioning without knowing what customers compare you to
5. **Premature New Category:** Inventing terminology when existing category works
6. **Positioning for Today Only:** No room for product evolution
7. **Not Testing with Customers:** Positioning created in conference room, not validated

### Signs of Weak Positioning
- Customers don't understand what you do
- You constantly explain "we're not really a [category]"
- Customers compare you to wrong competitors
- Sales cycles are long and end in "no decision"
- Pricing discussions are always hard

### Positioning Checklist
- Based on real competitive alternatives (not imagined)
- Unique attributes are objectively true
- Value expressed in customer outcomes, not features
- Target customer characteristics are specific
- Market category is familiar to buyers
- Tested with actual customers
- Sales team can articulate consistently
- Different from what competitors claim
- Allows for product evolution
